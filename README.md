# API_Weather_Tracker

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard that pulls real time information from global APIs and displays the information on the screen.

Description:
This site has a few key features that all work togehter via Javascript. On the left there is a search bar where you can enter a city. Once a city is entered the application calls an API and gathers information for the current weather in that city. This information is then displayed in the middle of the page. See below for an example:

The application also gathers information from an API and creates a 5 day forecast below the current weather. These 5 blocks include dates, temperature and humidity. See below:

All of this is contained in a visually pleasing and easy to use application:
